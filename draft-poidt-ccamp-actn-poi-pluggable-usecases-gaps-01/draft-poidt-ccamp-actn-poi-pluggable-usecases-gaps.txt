Abstract

   This document provides general overarching guidelines for control and
   management of packet over optical converged networks with coherent
   pluggables and focuses on operators' use cases and network scenarios.
   It provides a set of use cases which are needed for the control and
   management of the packet over optical networks which comprise devices
   with mixes of packet and optical functions where the optical
   functions may be provided on coherent pluggables.  The document
   provides a gap analysis to solve the use cases.

2.  Introduction

   Packet traffic is predominatly transferred over optical interfaces,
   some of which connect to optical networks or Optical Line Systems.
   Optical Line systems have been separated from packet systems, both of
   which have had specific dedicated devices.  In many existing network
   deployments, packet networks includingb direct connect electrical and
   optical interfaces and the optical networks are engineered, operated
   and controlled independently.  The operation of these packet and
   optical line networks is often siloed which results in non-optimal
   and inefficient networking.  Both packet and optical systems have had
   relatively independent evolution.  Optical interface technology has
   been developed with increasing capacity.  Meanwhile standardization
   has been progressed to a point where interoperable optical
   specifications are available, especially with the emergence of
   coherent optical techniques.

   Optical component design has continued to improve density to the
   point where a whole coherent optical terminal system that use to
   require many circuit packs can now fit onto a single small form
   factor "coherent plug".  Placing coherent plugs in a device with
   packet functions can reduce network cost, power consumption and
   footprint as well as improve data transfer rates, reduce latency and
   expand capacity (note that in some cases, other engineering and
   deployment considerations still lead to separate packet and optical
   solutions).

   Optical transmission/switching is analogue and requires complex and
   holistic analog control.  Consequently, coordination of control of
   the coherent plugs (in a device with packet functions) with the
   control of the rest of the optical network is highly desirable as
   this best enables robust network functionality and simplifies network
   operations.

   The combination of these above trends along with the desire to select
   best in breed components has led to the need for a standard way to
   control Coherent Modules between coherent pluggables and host device.
   Coherent Modules are more complex than non-coherent modules and led
   to extensions of Coherent CMIS [OIF-CMIS].  Standardization of CMIS
   is intended such that a plug from vendor X can be installed in vendor
   Y's device.

   The applicability of Abstraction and Control of TE Networks (ACTN)
   architecture [RFC8453] to Packet Optical Integration (POI) in the
   context of IP/MPLS and optical internetworking has been analyzed in
   [I-D.draft-ietf-teas-actn-poi-applicability].  This document further
   extends to applicability of ACTN with the integration of coherent
   pluggables in IP/MPLS devices.  An architecture analysis has been
   carried out by the MANTRA sub-group in the OOPT / TIP group (Open
   Optical & Packet Transport / Telecom Infra Project)
   [MANTRA-whitepaper-IPoWDM-convergent-SDN-architecture].

   This document provides guidellines for control and management of
   packet over optical converged networks and it is divided into
   following sections:

   *  Section 3 Packet over optical converged network context

   *  Section 4 Network Scenarios

   *  Section 5 Use cases for the control and management of Packet over
      Optical Converged Networks

   *  Section 5 Gap analysis

3.  Packet over Optical Converged Network Context

   A packet over optical network represents an efficient paradigm that
   harnesses the power of both packet-switching and optical
   technologies.  In this approach, some of the links of an overlay IP
   or MPLS packet network interface an underlying optical network.  The
   fusion of packet and optical networks offer a host of advantages,
   including accelerated data transfer rates, diminished latency, and
   expanded network capacity.

   In general, two deployment models can be used to deploy the packet
   over optical networks:

   *  Traditional architecture deployment model

   *  Deployment model with coherent pluggables

3.1.  Traditional Architecture Deployment Model

   The traditional architecture involves separation of the packet
   network from an optical network as shown in Figure 1.  In traditional
   approach, the packet network responsible for packet routing and
   forwarding is logically decoupled from the underlying optical
   transport network.  This approach offers several benefits, including
   the ability to scale each network independently, optimize resource
   utilization, and simplify network management through dedicated
   software control.

   Disaggregation enables network operators to choose best-of-breed
   components for each layer, fostering innovation and competition in
   the networking industry.  However, implementing and managing a
   disaggregated network also comes with challenges related to
   interoperability, integration, and maintaining end-to-end performance
   across the various networks.

                                   Model

3.2.  Deployment Model with Coherent Pluggables

   The second approach is to take advantage of the small implementation
   footprint of single small form factor pluggables (aka Coherent
   pluggables) and then place plugs directly into the packet devices as
   shown in Figure 2(A).  Placing this small form factor pluggable in a
   device with packet functions can reduce network cost, power
   consumption and footprint (when these benefits are not outweighed by
   other engineering considerations).  Depending on the application,
   distance between packet devices, quality of fibers and so on it might
   be that there is no need for a ROADM network.  In case direct
   connectivity between packet devices via plugs is possible the
   corresponding pluggables are considered part of the packet network
   itself.

   By incorporating coherent plugs into routers, network operators can
   achieve higher data rates, greater spectral efficiency, and improved
   tolerance to optical impairments.  This is especially valuable in
   scenarios where traditional electronic signaling might encounter
   limitations.  Coherent plugs enable optical transceivers to leverage
   advanced modulation schemes, digital signal processing, and error
   correction techniques, enhancing their ability to handle complex
   optical signals.

   Coherent pluggable optics can be deployed on routers independently of
   POI integration and many benefits can be achieved such as the
   elimination of transponders.  However, the major benefits from
   coherent pluggable optics in IP routers cannot be achieved without
   POI integration which yields the high capacity point to point links
   for Core and Data Center Interconnect use cases.

   One of the key advantages of using coherent plugs in routers is the
   potential to bridge the gap between long-haul and metro networks,
   providing a seamless and efficient transition of data across various
   network segments.  This technology can contribute to the evolution of
   high-speed data centers, interconnection between data centers, and
   the overall growth of data-intensive applications.

   As noted above, for some use-cases when the distance between packet
   devices is short and optical power of pluggables are enough, the
   photonics devices might not be needed as shown in Figure 2(B).

4.  Network Scenarios

   This section provides a set of packet over optical network scenarios,
   starting with the most common ones.

4.1.  Scenario A - High capacity point to point connection over
      dedicated direct fiber

   As depicted in Figure 4, this scenario considers a point-to-point
   optical service over a short distance (e.g., up to 100 km) using
   dedicated fiber.

   Note that there is no amplification and no protection in this
   scenario.

4.2.  Scenario B - High capacity point to point over shared fiber

   This scenario extends Figure 4 by making more efficient use of the
   deployed fiber infrastructure.

   As shown in Figure 5, this scenario considers a point-to-point
   optical service over a short distance (e.g., up to 100 km) using a
   physical optical network with DWDM filters and amplifiers.  Several
   point-to-point connections can be multiplexed from the same packet
   devices.

   Note that there is no protection in this scenario.

   The metro/regional network contains DWDM filters, amplifiers and
   optical switching.

5.  Operators' Use cases

   This section provides a set of packet over optical general use cases
   which are applicable to any network topologies in Section 4 and both
   for multi-layer networks using or not coherent pluggables in the
   routers.  These use cases are presented following current operators’
   priorities order.

   The use cases a generally applicable for both the traditional packet
   over optical integration based on grey interfaces in the IP routers
   and use of transponders/muxponders in the optical domain and for the
   packet over optical integration considering coherent DWDM pluggables
   in the IP routers over a media channel/Network Media channel in the
   optical domain.  For clarification purposes, the mention ‘valid for
   both’ has been added in the name of each use case else ‘valid for
   coherent pluggable’ when the use case is specific to the coherent
   pluggable approach.

5.1.  End-to-end multi-layer visibility and management (valid for both)

5.1.1.  End-to-end multi-layer network and service topology discovery
        and inventory

   The objective of the use case is to have a full end-to-end multi-
   layer view from all the layers and their inter-dependencies: service
   layer (e.g.  L3VPN/L2VPN), transport layer (RSVP-TE, SR-TE), IP layer
   (IGP), Ethernet layer, OTN L1 layer (optional), photonic L0 layer
   (OCh, OMS, OTS and fibre).  The discovery process, in addition to the
   layered logical view, includes the inventory discovery by each
   controller and exposure to the MDSC of the required information for a
   complete end-to-end multi-layer view of the network.

5.1.1.1.  Coherent DWDM pluggable insertion in the router linecard port
          ('valid for coherent pluggable')

   Once a pluggable module is inserted in the proper linecard port, the
   host device must recognise the hardware component (e.g. 400G ZR+
   pluggable module) and expose its attributes and capabilities to the
   controller.  For example, ZR+ modules can share the operational-mode-
   IDs supported that summarize the most important pluggable
   characteristics (such as FEC type, modulation format, baud rate, bit
   rate, etc.).  If the hardware component has been successfully
   recognised, the host device is then ready to create and expose the
   necessary logical arrangements.

   Several coherent pluggables seem to come with a factory default set
   of provisioning parameters (e.g. default channel number, default
   launched power, default application code id, laser-on, admin-state
   enabled etc.).  This factory default set of provisioning parameters
   varies from manufacturer to manufacturer.  This can allow a
   “plug&play” mode of operation over point-to-point connections (e.g.
   single wavelength over dark fiber).  However, when the optical
   connection between two pluggables is targeted to run over a DWDM Open
   Line System (OLS) network, optical validation & planning step is
   first required to determine the right target provisioning parameters
   values to be set in the pluggables before interconnecting them to
   their respective ROADM to avoid to impact any other existing optical
   channels already up and running in the OLS network.  It is critical
   for operators to have the same kind of commissioning phase
   independently of the deployment scenario: point-to-point vs ROADM
   meshed OLS network.  As a consequence, the use of factory default
   provisioning parameters may be fine but they shall always be able to
   be overwritten through router CLI or through Packet PNC to another
   set of default provisioning parameters defined by the operator that
   will change from pluggable to pluggable when deployed over an OLS
   network.  A reset of the coherent pluggable (through router CLI or
   through Packet PNC or due to a power off/on) shall always go back to
   this operator’s default set of provisioning parameters where, for
   example, the laser-state shall be ‘Off’ and admin-state ‘disabled’.

5.1.1.2.  Inventory of Coherent DWDM pluggable ('valid for coherent
          pluggable').

   The domain controller exposes to the MDSC hardware inventory
   information of the devices under its supervision.  For full router
   inventory (linecards, ports, etc.) see draft-ietf-ivy-network-
   inventory-yang.  In addition, capability information shall include
   the coherent pluggable transceiver capabilities.  These include, for
   instance, operational-modes supported (ITU-T application codes,
   organizational modes), min/max central-frequency range supported,
   min/max output power supported, min/max received power supported etc.
   In case of discovery of any HW mismatch between coherent DWDM
   pluggable and router linecard port capabilities the controller shall
   report HW mismatch alarm to MDSC.  An example is a linecard multi-
   rate port vs coherent DWDM pluggable with only one client/line rate
   (e.g. 1x400GE).

5.1.1.3.  Coherent pluggable OTSi service discovery information ('valid
          for coherent pluggable').

   Once a router-to-router connection with coherent pluggables has been
   created over a Network Media Channel in the optical Line system, then
   it is required by the O-PNC to expose the OTSi service.  The relevant
   OTSi information could be nominal-central-frequency, tx-output-power,
   operational-mode-ID, operational-status, admin-status etc.

5.1.1.4.  Discovery of layer relationships

   In case the operational mode has already been configured, the host
   device and the P-PNC controlller need to create the nececessary
   arrangements to navigate from the interface where the router traffic
   is injected up the port connecting to the fiber.  That is, the
   physical connectivity needs to be exposed.

5.1.2.  End-to-end multi-layer event/fault management (valid for both)

   The Target in this use case is to have a full end-to-end multi-layer
   correlation of events at different layers and domains (e.g.
   operational-status changes reported at OTS/OMS/OCh/ODUk (optional),
   IP link level, LSP level, L3VPN/L2VPN level etc.) so that final root
   cause can be quickly identified and fixed (e.g. fibre cut vs coherent
   DWDM pluggable failure).  This use case is divided in two: *
   Correlation of ZR+ connection (OTSi service) operational-status with
   MC/NMC operational-status (‘valid for coherent pluggable) In this
   case, the target is to expose to the MDSC both the events/faults from
   the ZR+ connection (OTSi service) and ZR+ pluggables as well as for
   the MC/NMC associated to this ZR+ connection (OTSi service) in the
   DWDM Line system so that proper correlation can be performed at MDSC
   level * Correlation of coherent pluggable operational status, port
   status, Ethernet link operational status, IP link status

5.1.3.  End-to-end multi-layer performance management (valid for both)

   In this use case, the goal is to have the possibility to analyse
   through performance monitoring of the different layers mentioned
   above and be able, in case of end-to-end L2VPN/L3VPN service
   degradation, to identify the root cause of the degradation.  For
   scaling purposes, the target should be, upon service fulfilment
   phase, to set up the right TCAs associated to each layer that can
   allow to meet the L2VPN/L3VPN service SLA (e.g. in terms of latency,
   jitter, BW, etc.).  This use case is divided in two:

5.1.3.1.  Performance management of the ZR+ connection (OTSi service)
          (‘valid for coherent pluggable)

   Target is to have the basic performance parameters of each OTSi
   service running between two pluggables exposed towards the MDSC.
   Best for operators could be to defined TCA (Threshold crossing
   alerts) from MDSC for each OTSI service and be notified only when the
   Thresholds defined are not met?  Operator shall be able to decide
   which parameters and for which OTSi service.  But all the parameters
   shall be visible if needed by operators.

   Note: Router shall provide also all the possible performance counters
   not only for OTSi service/Ethernet service etc. but also for the
   pluggable itself

   As an example operators should have the ability to get visibility on
   pre-FEC-BER for a given OTSi service and see the trend before post-
   FEC-BER is affected

5.1.3.2.  Performance management of the Ethernet link running over the
          OTSi service and also of the IP link running over this
          Ethernet link.

   TBC

5.2.  Inter-domain link validation (valid for coherent pluggable)

   Documenting the patch cord that connects the port of the coherent
   DWDM pluggable in the routers to the optical node (e.g. to the right
   Add/Drop port of the ROADM) is performed.  This manual operation is
   prone to human mistakes.  It would be highly beneficial for operators
   to have a mean to check/discover that the right pluggable has been
   connected to the desired ROADM port.  This use case requires the
   ability to expose to the MDSC the power levels at coherent DWDM
   pluggable side and at ROADM port side and vice versa to perform the
   right correlation and validation.

5.3.  End-to-end L3VPN/L2VPN service multi-layer fulfilment with SLA
      constraints (TE constraints) (valid for both)

   This use case is described in [draft-ietf-teas-actn-poi-
   applicability] for the SR-TE case which is relevant as target use
   case for operators.  If new connectivity is required between the
   routers and at optical level then full automation could be achieved.
   However considering PMO (Present Mode of Operation) in most
   operators, before an optical path is setup either between two native
   transponders or between two coherent pluggables in routers, a
   detailed optical planning and validation is always required.  So, the
   automation of this use case is considered more for future mode of
   operations (FMO) and has not the same priority as the previous two
   use cases.

5.4.  Pluggable to pluggable service Provisioning

   The following specific coherent DWDM pluggable provisioning sub-cases
   are identified: ### Manual Day 1 configuration (‘valid for coherent
   pluggable) Knowing the coherent pluggable characteristics
   (performance and optical impairments for a specific operational-mode-
   ID), the optical planning and validation process is performed and the
   following parameters are communicated by optical team to IP team:
   nominal-central-frequency, tx-output-power, operational-mode-ID and
   applicable threshold settings so that the coherent pluggables at both
   ends in the routers can be correctly configured in a manual way (e.g.
   through P-PNC or any other mean).  As prerequisite before the
   coherent pluggable configuration, the optical team has properly
   configured the Media Channel in the line system DWDM network through
   the O-PNC. ### Semi-manual Day 1 configuration (‘valid for coherent
   pluggable’) Same optical planning and validation is performed first
   by optical team and then parameters are provided to MDSC operations
   engineer so that they can be set-up at Hierarchical SDN controller
   level and provisioned by P-PNC in the corresponding router’s
   pluggables. ### Semi-Automated Day 1 configuration with Path
   Computation API request from MDSC towards PNC (‘valid for coherent
   pluggable’) In this use case the start of the pluggable to pluggable
   connectivity is triggered by the connectivity needs of a packet
   service (slice, vpn, etc...).  In the context of ACTC, the process
   would start with MDSC receiving the service request (e.g.  L3VPN) (or
   service provisioning from a GUI) and the MDSC determines that new
   optical connectivity is needed between two ZR/ZR+ pluggables which
   are already physically connected (patch cord) to ROADM nodes ports.
   MDSC sends a path computation request to the O-PNC asking for a
   specific MC/NMC between source Mux/Dmux and destination Mux/Dmux for
   a target bitrate (e.g. 400G) and O-PNC in coordination with planning
   tool calculates the optical path (after successful PCE computation)
   for this given bitrate (e.g. 400G) with a specific operational-mode-
   ID supported by these coherent pluggables.  It validates the optical
   path defining the central-frequency, output-power, operational-mode-
   ID to be configured in the coherent pluggables.  O-PNC updates the
   MDSC of successful optical path creation exposing this new optical
   path to the MDSC along with the nominal-central-frequency, the
   target-output-power, the operational-mode-ID for which this MC/NMC
   was created, etc.  The MDSC requests the relevant PNC to configure
   both source and target pluggables with the calculated parameters.
   MDSC uses the coherent pluggable CRUD data model to be used on MPI to
   configure the corresponding ZR+ connection (OTSi service) in the
   source and destination coherent pluggables.  This operation is
   supported by the PNC which will be in charge also to turn-on the
   laser and complete the optical path set-up.  At this point the
   optical path will be moved to operational state and the Packet
   traffic starts to flow. ### Fully automated Day 1 configuration (For
   future discussions)

5.5.  4.  End-to-end L3VPN/L2VPN service multi-layer provisioning with
      SLA constraints (TE constraints) (valid for both)

   This use case is described in
   [I-D.draft-ietf-teas-actn-poi-applicability] for the SR-TE case which
   is relevant as target use case for operators.  If new connectivity is
   required between the routers and at optical level then full
   automation could be achieved.  However considering PMO (Present Mode
   of Operation) in most operators, before an optical path is setup
   either between two native transponders or between two coherent
   pluggables in routers, a detailed optical planning and validation is
   typically required.  So, the automation of this use case is
   considered more for future mode of operations (FMO) and has not the
   same priority as the previous two use cases.

5.6.  End-to-end L3VPN/L2VPN service multi-layer with SLA constraints
      (TE constraints) with optical restoration support (valid for both
      but here focusing on the coherent pluggable)

   This use case has not the same priority as the previous ones as
   protection in multi-layer Core/Backhaul networks is usually
   implemented at IP layer (e.g.  FRR with RSVP-TE, TI-LFA with SR and
   SR policies in SR-TE) to avoid proven protection races. a.  ZR+ links
   over DWDM network can be considered out of the L0 control plane so
   that no restoration is applied to those links b.  ZR+ links over DWDM
   network can be considered part of the L0 control plane but no
   restoration is enabled for those links c.  ZR+ links over DWDM
   network can be considered as part of the L0 control plane with
   restoration enabled for those links but nominal-central-frequeny is
   maintained unchanged after L0 restoration.  Only output-power could
   be tuned for the new restored path determined by the L0 control plane
   d.  ZR+ links over DWDM network can be considered as part of the L0
   control plane with restoration enabled for those links and nominal-
   central-frequency and output power need to be tuned for the new
   restored path determined by the L0 control plane.
